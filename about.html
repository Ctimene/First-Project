                        This page isn't just about me, but the website's namesake, <i>Citmene</i>. <br>
                        <br>
                        Ctimene is a character from Homer's epic poem, <i>The Odyssey</i>, which tells the story of Odysseus's journey home after the Trojan War. 
                        She is the daughter of Laertes and Anticlea, the former King and Queen of Ithaca, and the younger sister of Odysseus, the current King of Ithaca. Ctimene was raised as a close equal to the the family's servant, Eumaeus, who was later the first mortal to meet Odysseus once he returns. Ctimene was married to Eurylochus, the second-in-command of Odysseus' ship during the return to Ithaca after the Trojan War. Both Ctimene and her husband were from the island of Same, near Ithaca. <br>
                        <br>
                        Ctimene is a minor character in the poem, but her presence is significant in the context of Odysseus's family and his homecoming. Her name, Ctimene, means "honored" or "esteemed," which reflects her status as a member of the royal family. <br>
                        The choice of the name Ctimene for this website is a nod to the character's significance in Greek mythology and literature, as well as a personal connection to the themes of family, honor, and homecoming that resonate throughout the story. <br>
                        In addition to her role in <i>The Odyssey</i>, Ctimene has also been referenced in other works of literature and art, including the <italics>Metamorphoses</italics> by Ovid and the <italics>Argonautica</italics> by Apollonius of Rhodes. Her character has been interpreted in various ways, but she is generally seen as a symbol of loyalty, strength, and resilience. <br>
                        Overall, Ctimene is a fascinating character with a rich history and cultural significance. Her name has become synonymous with honor and esteem, and her story continues to inspire and resonate with people today. <br>
