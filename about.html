                        <br>
                        This page isn't just about me, but the website's namesake, <i>Citmene</i>, and why it was chosen. <br>
                        <br>
                        Ctimene is a character from Homer's epic poem, <i>The Odyssey</i>. She is the daughter of Laertes and Anticlea, the former King and Queen of Ithaca, and the younger sister of Odysseus, the current King of Ithaca. 
                        Despite being the princess of Ithaca, Ctimene was raised as a close equal to the family's enslaved servant, Eumaeus. 
                        Ctimene was married off to Eurylochus of Same, the second-in-command of Odysseus's ship, but, similarly to the rest of Odysseus's men, Eurylochus died before reaching home. 
                        Ctimene was married to Eurylochus for a large bride-price, and while it wasn't explicitly stated, it was likely to secure a powerful connection for the royal family, as was common practice.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ctimene is a minor character in the poem, mentioned once by Eumaeus. Still, I find her presence to be significant in the context of Odysseus's family, his homecoming and the death of Odysseus's men. 
                        What little is known about Ctimene reflects the treatment of royal women and girls in the Bronze Age of Greece. 
                        Briefly showing how they were seen as less than most men, despite being royalty, and more equal to property, which could be traded for the benefit of the family. <br>
                        <br>
                        The choice of the name Ctimene for this website is a nod to my love for <i>The Odyssey</i> and to the theme of the Hack Club event this project will be submitted to, the Athena Award 
                        (especially since Athena is the goddess who favours Odysseus and aids him on his journey). <br>
                        <br>
                        If you have any questions or comments about Ctimene or the website, please feel free to reach out through the Contact page. <br>
                        I hope you enjoy exploring the site and learning more about the character and her significance in Greek mythology and literature. <br>
                        Thank you for visiting Ctimene! <br>
