                        Welcome To My First Website!
                    </h1>
                    <p class="hero-text">
                        This is an incredibly simple website created to showcase my beginner skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Despite its simplicity, this website took longer than I am willing to admit and I hold some sort of pride in it. <br>
                        It features a simple design, containing four seperate pages: Home, About, Blog, and Contact. With the Home page being the one you are currently on, the About page detailing information about Ctimene, the Blog page explaining my hopes and ideas for future projects, and the Contact page being pretty self-explainitory. <br>
                        Each page is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, though there may be a few bugs here and there. Especially in being a first project, it is likely riddled with small  issues. Therefore, for the sake of kindness and my dwindling sanity, please turn a blind eye if the issue isn't resulting in the complete inability to use the website itself. <br>
                        Feel free to explore the site and see what I've learned so far. (It's not a lot but it's something!) <br>
                        I hope you enjoy your visit! <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> This website is a work in progress, and I plan to add more features and content in the future.
