# First-Project
First Project created for Athena Project (Personal Website, not Portfolio).
This is my first project I've ever created using HTML and CSS. Although I thought I might use JavaScript, I ultimately decided not to.

This website contains four different pages, mostly containing text, with a favicon and logo. It doesn't contain many functions due to it being my first web development project, though I hope for future projects to be more advanced.
